For designing a Car rental System should have multiple different operations that could be performed 

such as managing the cars available for rent,
processing customer requests
handling payments 
and maintaing a database of rentals.

for the multiple different operations i will be using different patterns.

1. factory Method Pattern : --->>> can be used for creating car objects like Sedan, SUV,Hatchback etc based on user request
				You may have different types of cars with varying attributes, 
				and the choice of car is based on the user’s preference or availability.

2. The Singleton Pattern --->>  ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. 
				In a car rental system, you might use this pattern for classes like RentalService or CarDatabase, 
				where you need a single, consistent instance to manage all rentals.
				ensuring that a single instance of the RentalService handling all car bookings, 
				which avoids conflicts or duplication of rental transactions.

3. Strategy pattern --->> 	it can be used to define various algorithms and classes for defining different type of payment methods.
				also provide different payment strategies based on the duration, type of car and special offers on holidays.
				If a customer rents a car for a long period, you might apply a different pricing strategy 
				than if they rented for a short period.

4. Observer Pattern -->>     	The Observer Pattern is useful for implementing a system where changes to one object (e.g., car availability) 
				automatically notify other dependent objects. It is used for managing real-time updates.
				ity is useful Notify customers when a specific car model becomes available, 
				or send reminders when the rental period is about to end.


step 1. Customer Accesses the Car Rental System
observer pattern 


step 2. Step 2: Customer Searches for Available Cars
Strategy Pattern

Step 3: Car Selection

Factory Method Pattern
Decorator Pattern


step 4: payment and Notification
Strategy pattern: to give Different payment methods and strategies based on duration, type of car etc.

Singelton pattern: Ensures a single point of notification and SMS management.

step 5: Car Pick-Up and Return:

state pattern : handles the tranistion from different stages from Available -> Reserved-> picked up

The customer arrives at the rental location, and the system checks the car’s availability.
If the car is returned early or late, the system will calculate any penalties or refunds.
The customer is able to return the car, and the system updates the car’s availability status accordingly.
